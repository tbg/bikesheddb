# BikeshedDB

In accordance with the [Law Of
Triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality), the name is the
most frequently publicly discussed property of
[CockroachDB](https://cockroachlabs.com).

The name will not change, but if you care enough about it that you're willing
to let a number of brutal and completely untested search-and-replace
invocations stir up the source code, you can have a version of CockroachDB
jerry-rigged to match your preference!

```
$ ./build.sh
Enter the name of your new database software:
MyFancyDB
[...]

$ ./myfancydb
MyFancyDB command-line interface and server.

Usage:
  myfancydb [command]

[...]
```

# Disclaimer

Don't actually use this. If you like CockroachDB but dislike the name, consider
giving it a shot anyway; it might just grow on you.
